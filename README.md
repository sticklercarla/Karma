# Karma App

Karma App is built entirely with Ruby on Rails. It is a social app where users can follow and unfollow other users and create and send them small gifts. It exists solely as a way to send nice things to your friends. Log in or create an account and give gifts and receive good karma!

Karma was built as part of a pair programming project at The Flatiron School along with Otha Hernandez https://github.com/othaderek. The original code is located at https://github.com/othaderek/karma-app. This current version has been updated since then.
